# domeDots

IMPORTANT: pix2deg (ie number of pixels per deg) must be entered at top of flowDots function. This can be calculated as display.resolution(1)/angular width of the projection in the dome if required.

flowDots is the function to call. 
movingDotsDome is the actual stimulus function. 
linv2angv and angv2linv are support functions.

Requires PsychToolbox (most likely the latest version is necessary).
